# To-do list

- [ ] Move some of these To-do items to github issues so that we can reference them
- [ ] Show download processing status on the front-end
  - [ ] When you press download there should be some sort of status indiator on the front-end that changes when the download is done / fails.
  - [ ] (Potentially) The front-end should not wait for results on the same HTTP request that a download was initiated on and should instead poll for results. 
- [ ] Session poll thread on the front-end
  - [ ] Every 10ish seconds the front-end should poll an endpoint to ask what the status of its session is.
  - [ ] The status should be displayed somewhere on the page
  - [ ] If the session has died then some blocking indication should be given
- [ ] Create small debug page (e.g. `/sessions.html`) that shows a list of the active sessions
- [ ] Make the Noty notifactions have a theme that matches the rest of the app
- [ ] Dummy password authentication.
  - [ ] The landing page should have a hardcoded password prompt that you must pass in order to use the page. Passing this prompt should set a 1-day cookie that bypasses it. 
- [ ] Total rework of model saving and loading. Currently the tool generates a custom link that a model can be restored at however this is brittle and unintuitive to users.
  - [x] Rename ServerModelsAbstract to ModelSessionAbstract throughout.
    - [x] Clean up (remove NAIP references) and re-document the interface
    - [x] Add `save_state_to()` and `load_state_from()` methods to the interface. Now, "ServerModels" will be responsible for serializing their state to a directory.
  - [ ] Add a checkpoint model button to the front-end.
    - [ ] This should prompt for a checkpoint name.
    - [ ] This should save the model to disk.
    - [ ] This should save an entry in a checkpoint database.
  - [ ] The landing page should have an additional section that shows available checkpoints for each (dataset, model) pair. Additionally the landing page should give the option to start from an empty model. 
- [ ] Add ability for multiple named basemaps to be passed through the entries in `datasets.json`
  - [ ] The front-end should display all basemaps for the selected dataset.
  - [ ] Add a hotkey to switch between the custom basemap layers
- [ ] Checkpoint handling on the landing page
  - [x] Add "valid_models" key to each dataset that is a list of acceptable models.
  - [ ] The expected flow is: "user selects a dataset" --> "valid list of models are displayed" --> "user selects a model" --> "current list of checkpoints are displayed" --> "user selects a checkpoint or 'new'" --> "start server button is enabled"
  - [ ] The "current list of checkpoints" should have icons that allow them to be renamed or deleted.
  - [ ] When a checkpoint is selected we should display useful information about it: how many points, how many sessions, etc.
- [ ] The commnication between `server.py` and `worker.py` needs to be re-worked.
  - Currently `server.py` will spawn an instance of `worker.py` for every "session" that is created through the front-end. Communication between the server and the worker are handled by `rpyc` RPC calls. In long running computations on the worker (e.g. running a model over a tile), the connection will time-out. Also, the RPC call seems to incur a significant overhead when passing large arrays (e.g. a 7000x7000x20 numpy array).
  - Celery with a Redis backend might be a good solution here.
  - [ ] Move this to a GitHub issue
- [ ] Create actual `unittest` test cases for most server functionality
  - [ ] Use the existing master branch to get expected responses from various functions
  - [ ] Convert the existing cases to use `unittest`
- [ ] The front-end does not need to call `get_input()` or display the image/model results in the top-right corner
- [ ] Rebase/merge the feature/cycle branch
- [ ] Implement a small tutorial screen / page that explains how to use the tool
- [ ] The `pred_tile` code path should return the class statistics directly instead of saving to txt
  - [ ] Show class statistics when click on a polygon
- [ ] Re-visit the ability to draw / run inference over polygons
  - Currently the workflows for interacting with "user added polygons" and "dataset polygons" are totally separate which is confusing for everyone. These should be merged.
  - [ ] When the user firsts adds a polygon there should be a new "User layer" that is added to the list of current zones in the bottom left
  - [ ] The user is free to add, delete, change polygons in this layer
  - [ ] The user should be able to download this layer as a geojson
  - [ ] The user should be able to click on any current polygon in this zone and run inference over it by pressing "Download" like usual
- [ ] Re-visit the `train_autoencoder.py` script
  - [ ] Rename to something more appropriate
  - [ ] Convert to PyTorch.
  - [ ] After fitting the initial KMeans model do not generate a giant in-memory dataset. Instead, sample on-the-fly during a training loop
- [ ] Come up with an actual name for the project
- [ ] Create a script to automatically calculate the bounds for each dataset so that we can include those in the entries in `datasets.json`.
  - Without the bounds of a tileLayer, leaflet will try to grab imagery for the entire viewport (and will get many 404 errors in return). This is annoying. 

## Documentation

- [ ] Create an updated video demo / instructional video
- [ ] Document the existing API exposed by `server.py`, create `API.md`
- [ ] Create simple instructions for how to use the tool to include in `README.md`
- [ ] Document the DataLoaderAbstract interface
- [x] Document the ModelSessionAbstract interface
- [ ] Document the process by which users can train / add an unsupervised model using the `training/train_autoencoder.py` script.
